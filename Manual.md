## Using a Virtual Monitor

Starting from **osxrdp 1.3**, osxrdp supports the **Virtual Monitor** feature.\
This feature sets the remote-control resolution to match the client window size, regardless of the host computer’s physical monitor resolution.\
When using the Virtual Monitor feature, the host computer’s screen is provided according to the client’s resolution, allowing you to control the host computer with excellent image quality.\
When the Virtual Monitor feature is enabled, the host computer’s monitor will be disabled while the remote session is connected (similar to ARD’s High Performance mode).

You can enable the Virtual Monitor feature by selecting the Session type on the initial connection screen.

- **osxup**:  
  Starts remote control with the Virtual Monitor enabled.
- **osxup (no virtual display)**:  
  Starts remote control without using the Virtual Monitor. Use this option if you have issues when using the Virtual Monitor.

## Using File Copy

Starting from **osxrdp 2.0.0**, osxrdp supports file and folder copy between the client and server.

- **Copying files from the server (macOS) to the client**:  
  This works the same way as when connected to a Windows host. In Finder, select the files or folders and copy them with **Control + C**, then paste them with **Ctrl + V** in File Explorer or another file manager on the client computer.
- **Copying files from the client, such as mstsc, to the server (macOS)**:  
  Follow these steps:
  1. On the client computer, select the files or folders and copy them with **Ctrl + C**.
  2. On the server (macOS), open the OSXRDP menu from the menu bar (a notification may appear when files are ready).
  3. Choose **Save … to Downloads** for a one-click save, or **Save … to Folder…** to pick a destination.
  4. Wait for the progress window. On success you can choose **Show in Finder**.

## Connection status

The main window shows Accessibility, Screen Recording, remote agent, and RDP session status.  
If permissions are missing at launch, the permission sheet opens automatically. Use **Check Status** for a short diagnostic summary. The menu-bar icon is green when healthy, orange when permissions are missing, and red when the agent is stopped.

## Other
* For the best stability, it is recommended that the remote Mac be connected to a wired network.\
  Delays may occur due to AWDL when using WI-FI.\
  Change the channel on your WI-FI AP or disable AWDL on Mac.

* You must disable sleep mode for continuous remote access.

* If you cannot connect from an external computer using an RDP client,\
  check whether the `3389/tcp` port is blocked by the firewall.\
  Using Terminal, check whether the xrdp and osxrdp processes are running. \
